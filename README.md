        <p>Hello everyone. My name is Jake . I attended William Jewell College in the northeast corridor of the Kansas City area where I got my degree in Sport Management & Communications. For the past 6 years I have been working in a variety of sales roles, and primarily for the past 3 years I have been working within the manufacturing/industrial automation field. I am currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Development course through MIT because of my strong desire to get involved within the Software/Tech field. In my spare time I enjoy exercise, watching sports and playing Xbox/PC games. </p>
