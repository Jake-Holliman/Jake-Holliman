        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jake Holliman. I attended William Jewell College in the northeast corridor of the Kansas City area where I played football and got my degree in Sport Management & Communications. For the past 6 years I have been working in a variety of sales roles, and primarialy for the past 3 years I have been working within the manufacturing/industrial automation field. I am currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Development course through MIT because of my strong desire to get involved within the Software/Tech field in order to take the next step in my career. In my spare time I enjoy exercise, watching sports and playing Xbox/PC games. </p>
